# data-science-journey

started a new data science course on udemy. it is really exciting.
learnt alot on probability and the different term 
some common misunderstood words and now i feel like a data scientist already
so under probability i learnt about combination permutation and other realated terms, so i decided to write a program on it to better understand how it works.
